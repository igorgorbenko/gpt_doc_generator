# Music Band Documentation

This documentation provides details about a Python program simulating a music band with members playing different musical instruments.

## Overview

The program defines classes for different musical instruments and band members playing those instruments. Each class represents a specific instrument and includes methods for playing the instrument in different styles.

## Classes

### `MusicInstrument`

- **Attributes**:
  - `player`: The name of the player.
  - `num_strings`: The number of strings the instrument has.
  - `type`: The type of the instrument (default is acoustic).

- **Methods**:
  - `play_it(notes)`: Plays the instrument based on the type.

### `Guitar`

- **Attributes**:
  - Inherits from `MusicInstrument`.
  
- **Methods**:
  - `strum_chords(chords)`: Strums the guitar with given chords.

### `Bass`

- **Attributes**:
  - Inherits from `MusicInstrument`.
  
- **Methods**:
  - `play_riff(riff)`: Plays a riff on the bass guitar.

### `Drums`

- **Attributes**:
  - Inherits from `MusicInstrument`.
  
- **Methods**:
  - `hit_drums(drum_type)`: Hits the drums with the specified drum type.

## Example Band Setup

The code sets up a band with the following members and instruments:

1. **Guitarist**:
   - Name: Karl
   - Number of strings: 6
   - Type: Electric
   - Method: `strum_chords(["Am", "Em", "Dm"])`

2. **Bassist**:
   - Name: Dallas
   - Number of strings: 4
   - Type: Acoustic
   - Method: `play_riff("bassline")`

3. **Drummer**:
   - Name: George
   - Type: Acoustic
   - Method: `hit_drums("snare")`

## Band Performance

The band plays a song where each member showcases their skills:
1. Guitarist Karl strums chords.
2. Bassist Dallas plays a bassline riff.
3. Drummer George hits the snare drum.

After the performance, each member plays a solo or a unique style:
- Karl plays a guitar solo.
- Dallas plays a funky bassline.
- George performs a drum solo.

This Python program demonstrates a simple music band simulation where each member contributes their unique sound to create music together.
